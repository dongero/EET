Conclusion
This lab was great! I had some fun and try out some different things.
I appoligize for using the single resistor again on the 4 LEDs. This
lab clearly displays the short coming of using only one resister haha.
When all LEDs are lit up you can barely tell they're on in the video.
Hope this is ok.

I mentioned in a discussion post that I changed some of the circuit 
to get it to function. For this reason I submitted two KiCad files,
one version references the schematic you gave us and the other is 
the one I ended up breadboarding. All changes are mentioned in the
discussion post.

I submitted an extra video using a 3.579545 MHz clock signal.
3.579545 MHz is known as the color burst frequency! It's a crystal 
oscilator used to display color information on old CRT TVs.
I've been messing around with it recently since I make glitchy video
synthesizers with my bandmate here in Portland (we also make noise
machines and drum synths for our music).
In the video you'll see that I was able to generate some weird wavey lines.
Its hard to see with the phone recording but there is a bit of color.
The frequencies are mostly way above hearing range or anything a speaker 
can output. 
Color is pretty hard to get on CRT TVs unless you use a weird combination
of frequencies and amplitudes. Again, still exploring!

Oh, and I made sure to keep the breadboard drawing super simple.
