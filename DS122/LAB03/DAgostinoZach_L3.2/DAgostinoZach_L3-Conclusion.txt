LAB 03 Conclusion:

This lab was cool. It was fun to work out the combination.
I'd like to make some new jumper wires for myself.
My current supply is very silly.

The total time spent on the lab is hard to say.
Here's the breakdown:
15 minutes on KiCad
15 minutes on drawing the breadboard
45 minutes on breadboarding
*The unit was not functioning correctly so I submitted what I had for Week 1.

I revisited the breadboard 2 more times and spent 3-4 hours with it each time.
I figured I had a wire incorrectly placed or maybe a bad jumper.
So I went over the schematic many many times and slowly felt myself going crazy.

I eventually read the 74ls74 datasheet and learned pins 1, 4, 10, and 13 needed to be held high.

Eitherway, the lab was super exciting to complete. It's very cool. 
I was planning to implement the arduino, but did not get to it. 
Maybe next time!
