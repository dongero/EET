LAB 04 - Stepper Mottor Conclusion

Procedure 1
S0 and S1
-When S0 and S1 are held HIGH, parallel data is loaded
-Once S0 is LOW and S1 is HIGH, bits will be shifted to the right
-When S0 is HIGH and S1 is LOW, bits will be shifted to the left

Frequency
-When 74LS194 is clocked at 40Hz each LED will blink at 10Hz
--> 40Hz/4 = 10Hz

Procedure 2
To create a FULL STEP DRIVE
-Set A and B HIGH - this will shift two bits at a time

Conclusion:
I enjoyed this project and am excited to see more applications for it
in the future. Its cool how little external circuitry there is.

I work with audio electronics so most applications I can think of 
deal with using this as a sequencer or clock divider/generator.

I'm also thinking it can be used effectively to allow switching
between different settings without the need for multiple buttons.

Is there a simple way to have S0 and S1 set HIGH upon powering on 
and then to have S0 or S1 pulled to GND shortly after the parellel 
data is loaded?
I tried using a high pass RC circuit in order to filter out the DC 
offset but it didnt seem to work.
